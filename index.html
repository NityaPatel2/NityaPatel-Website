        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nitya Patel and I am currently a business major at the University of California, Riverside as a freshman. I have taken some business classes during highschool as well as in my first year of college teaching me the fundamentals of business from all sectors, from marketing to sales to accounting to economics and much more. I think these classes really helped me build up the basics when it comes to learning and applying principles of business and because my foundation is good, it helped set me up for more advanced business classes.

Although my professional career has not officially started, I have participated in many clubs during high school such as the investment club, DECA, and accounting club. The investment club helped me understand what the stock market is, how it works and how we as investors can use it to our advantage whether that be long term or short term, but also the risks that come with investing. DECA has taught me how to speak to individuals and how to sell myself as what I am talking about. I also learned the different intricacies of running a business. How costs and revenues are calculated, how a business plan of action is created and thought of, as well as how important it is to have an online presence in todayâ€™s age. Finally, the accounting club has taught me about basic tax information as well as how companies manage their finances. I studied how balance sheets work and what counts as a liability and an asset and how the balance sheet can affect if a company can go public in the stock market or if they are allowed certain business loans. All these together gave me a broader understanding opf all the different things that take place under the umbrella of business.

I may not have had professional experience when it comes to internships and things like that, but I do currently work at staples and sell products to customers. Selling things like computers, chairs, and other technology help me develop my marketing and sales skills. It helps me understand how to talk to customers and how every customer is different and you may have to approach them differently. How to fulfill their needs and if I can not help them out, I make sure that they leave the store with at least somewhat of a solution such as directing them to another store or ordering for them online so they are more inclined to do business with Staples again.

All in all, I think that the combination of the classes I have taken, the clubs that I participated in, as well as the job that I work help make me a great student of business and although I do think that I have a very good grasp on the world of business, I also know that there is still much for me to learn and I am ready to take that challenge wherever that may be.
